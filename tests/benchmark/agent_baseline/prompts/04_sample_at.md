You are writing one small self-contained Python module. Work exclusively inside /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-farzinashouri-projects-GeoCase-geocase/1cff4f84-ccad-4982-b62f-93cdd0d100d5/scratchpad/agentlab — do not read or modify anything outside that directory.

Task: Implement a function `sample_at(raster_path, lon, lat)` that opens a single-band GeoTIFF with rasterio and returns the raster's value at the given WGS84 longitude/latitude as a `float`, or `None` if the raster has no data at that location. The GeoTIFF may be in any coordinate reference system.

Requirements:
- Save the module as /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-farzinashouri-projects-GeoCase-geocase/1cff4f84-ccad-4982-b62f-93cdd0d100d5/scratchpad/agentlab/generated/gen_sample_at.py. Importing the module must have no side effects.
- Interpreter: /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-farzinashouri-projects-GeoCase-geocase/1cff4f84-ccad-4982-b62f-93cdd0d100d5/scratchpad/agentlab/venv/bin/python (Python 3 with shapely 2.1, pyproj 3.7, rasterio 1.4, numpy, and scikit-learn installed). Use only the standard library plus whichever of these packages you need.
- Verify that your code actually runs before finishing; put any scratch test files under /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-farzinashouri-projects-GeoCase-geocase/1cff4f84-ccad-4982-b62f-93cdd0d100d5/scratchpad/agentlab/scratch_sample_at/, not inside the module.
- When finished, reply with one line starting with DONE, followed by a one-sentence summary of your approach.
